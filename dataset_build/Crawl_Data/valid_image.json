Get in touch for details.\n            Hemp grows wild throughout Nepal and has long been used to create fabrics used in clothe making etc. You can now own a piece of this ancient tradition in the form of a functional, stylish laptop case.\n\n            Design Details:\n            The main pocket (where your laptop goes) as well as the top flap, are made with wild hemp, harvested, spun and handwoven here in Nepal.\n            The inside has Tibetain sheeps\u2019 wool for an effective, natural and sustainable padding (instead of chemical based neoprene used in most cases).\n            The smaller, front pocket uses recycled wild hemp cloth \u2013 from bags used by farmers from rural Nepal. This is slightly thinner than the other wild hemp fabric in this item and because of its past use is beautifully soft. This front pocket can accommodate your laptop charger as well as a note book/pens etc. making it super convenient.\n\n            No Chemicals or Chemical Dyes\n            We use only natural plant/mineral based dyes.\n            We use no bleach or other chemical treatments or dyes in our production process.\n            The fibres are hand-harvested, washed in pure Himalayan water and hand-spun, weaved and stitched.\n\n            SUPPORTING RURAL LIVELIHOODS IN NEPAL\n            We work with a small group of Nepali handcrafters and local communities harvesting wild fibres to bring you these yoga accessories.
